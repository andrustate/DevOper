I created this image through Dockerfile wich has: 
- link to my first image with ubuntu and nginx inside, 
- command for starting nginx, 
- ENV variable.
I used command for  docker run -d -p 80:80 andrustate/ubuntu_nginxrun_envvar_infile
And i tunned autobuilding with GitHub.
You can see Dockerfile in my github or dockerhub repositories.
